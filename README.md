## Daniel 7: 13-14: Son of Man
13“In my vision at night I looked, and there before me was one like a son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient of Days and was led into his presence. 14He was given authority, glory and sovereign power; all nations and peoples of every language worshiped him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed.
13Ta lại nhìn-xem trong những sự hiện-thấy ban đêm, nầy, có một người giống như con người đến với những đám mây trên trời; người tới đến Đấng Thượng-cổ và bị dẫn đến trước mặt Ngài. 14Người được ban cho quyền-thế, vinh-hiển, và nước; hầu cho hết thảy các dân, các nước, các thứ tiếng đều hầu-việc người. Quyền-thế người là quyền-thế đời đời chẳng qua đi, và nước người không bao giờ phải hủy-phá.

## Why does God insist on Being Glorified
https://www.maxanders.com/why-does-god-insist-on-being-glorified/
- First, because He is truly glorious, and not to see that reveals an insufficiency, an inadequacy, a limitation in us. Since God is glorious and praiseworthy, there is something wrong with us if we don’t see it. And since God wants us to be mature and complete, lacking in nothing (James 1:2-4), He commissions us to glorify Him, for our good, so that we will come to see reality accurately.
- Second, God calls on us to glorify Him because we need to place Him as the highest thing in our life for our own good… in order to be fulfilled and safe. If anything matters more to us than God, then we are giving higher glory to something else… and if that thing is taken away from us, as it may easily be, we are shattered.

So, we glorify God because He is glorious, and if we don’t see that, there is a deficiency in us that needs to be corrected, for our own good. And, we glorify God because only as we perceive Him as the most important thing in life will we be truly safe.

So, God is not a cosmic egomaniac, demanding that we grovel at His feet whether we want to or not. Rather, He is a loving heavenly Father, and everything He asks of us is to give something good to us and keep some harm from us.

God wants us to grow, to increase, to “become,” to the point that we actually perceive His weight accurately, and accurately perceiving it, we glorify Him as the greatest value in life.
